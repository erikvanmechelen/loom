## When Conventions Aren't Applicable

Conventional creative writing advice is "Show, don't tell". 

But in business, showing AND telling is best. 

That's why I've been using Loom for almost three years. 

Said another way: Information passes from me to my audience more efficiently and more persuasively.

Now that I've shared how I see Loom as a customer, let's move on. 

CONGRATS on [the Series B](https://www.loom.com/blog/why-we-raised-a-30m-series-b-from-sequoia/). It definitely seems like Loom is in a good position to make communication more human, at scale.

Loom has improved my workflow by saving time and making communication at work fun! The core product and the [pro features](https://www.loom.com/blog/engineering-lessons-shipping-loom-pro/) have enhanced the effectiveness of my product and community work with my startup, which has built a gamification education service called [Octalysis Prime](https://island.octalysisprime.com/#!/signup). 

With Loom, it's easier than ever to align with the CEO, the Head of Marketing, Dev, and fellow PM, especially given our distribution between SÃ£o Paulo, California, and Minnesota. Prior to working on Octalysis Prime, I designed an iPhone game and served as a Business Process Consultant in Target's Merchandise Planning Systems Development team. 

As a PM with Loom, I believe my interpersonal skills, ability to create productive relationships with every individual within the organization, and my balanced attack of design/business/tech will put us on pace to scale Loom to our expectations.

### The Challenge Loom Faces, And Why I'm Energized

Recently, we transitioned Octalysis Prime to a freemium model. Since I'm responsible for Community first, and then Product, it was on me to [listen to members](https://vimeo.com/259389911/c56dfaac57), communicate our roadmap, and continually help them reach their goals. Meanwhile, I helped the team efficiently execute on our go-to-market strategy for freemium. In the last two months we had our lowest churn in the past year and the path is set for freemium to play out. 

Here's an important question: Can we improve our conversion of freemium members to premium subscription members?

This will be an important challenge for Loom to tackle as well. 

Loom is a great product, but companies will ask themselves why they should pay for something that already works, and is currently free. 

"But it's 10x better than email!" Maybe. 

Having reviewed the Product Roadmap, I believe that Loom--with pro and enterprise features--will be 10x better than email, and a necessary addition to any company serious about communicating effectively in the next decade.

This said, I don't think Loom as instantiated TODAY is there quite yet. And Loom isn't short of competitors who could make copycats or their own versions of video-based communication.

Helping Loom deliver would by a large margin be my biggest challenge yet. But for a product I'm passionate about, in a space I'm passionate about--communication at work--and for a company with A+ people surrounding me, I know I'll rise to it. 

From my read of your posting and from my take on your culture, you're looking for someone who can own the role from Day 1, but who is also coachable, and finally, a curious and weird individual who makes other people better.

Let's make this audacious goal a reality.

## A Few Questions

How does Loom approach product? Which workflows are working? I sense that Loom approaches Product cross-functionally. Can you share more?

What is the current relationship between teams at Loom? How are decisions made? 

I want to hear some stories that encapsulate your definition of 'weird'.

## Welcome to Erik van Mechelen's Loom Product Review

[This Folder](https://loom.com/share/folder/d198ed4f3a874c698419309a424eec02) contains all the Looms I made for my product review.

After the Product Review, Roadmap, etc. etc., I share a few thoughts about why I might be the best person for this role and also to fit into your existing team at Loom

After...... we'll talk about Security & Collaboration, two top priorities in the near term if Loom is going to be the go-to communication app for companies. 

I thought you might be worried...about the security...of your shit. 

And something funny about collaboration. 

^^ this shows my sense of humor

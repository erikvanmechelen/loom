## Let's Make Audacious Goals a Reality

First, off, congrats on [the Series B](https://www.loom.com/blog/why-we-raised-a-30m-series-b-from-sequoia/). It definitely seems like Loom is in a good position to make communication more human, at scale. 

I'd love to join as [the PM for the core platform](https://jobs.lever.co/useloom/b7066f2b-fdde-4baf-a1a6-0c23a78f0c97).

If you only have a few minutes, consider watching [this video on prioritizing the Product Roadmap](https://www.loom.com/share/3f83beb7eb8c46d683b98db1e9cfd834).

## When Conventions Aren't Applicable

Conventional creative writing advice is "Show, don't tell". 

But in business, showing AND telling is best. 

That's why I've been using Loom for almost three years. 

Said another way: With Loom, information passes from me to my audience more efficiently and more persuasively. 

Loom has improved my workflow by saving time and making communication at work fun! The core product and the [pro features](https://www.loom.com/blog/engineering-lessons-shipping-loom-pro/) have enhanced the effectiveness of my product and community work with my startup, which has built a gamification education service called [Octalysis Prime](https://island.octalysisprime.com/#!/signup). 

With Loom, it's easier than ever to align with the CEO, the Head of Marketing, Dev, and fellow PM, especially given our distribution between SÃ£o Paulo, California, and Minnesota. Prior to working on Octalysis Prime, I designed an iPhone game and served as a Business Process Consultant representing the voice of hundreds of users and developing requirements in Target's Merchandise Planning Systems Development team. It was there at age 25, already 7 years ago (gasp!), that I gave my first major talk to a big group, our 250-person software team. Seeing how comfortable I was, my manager selected me to rep our 50-person team in a larger cross-functional working group.

Now that I've shared my perspective as a Loom customer, let's move on to discuss the product roadmap and how the PM role for the core platform--PC, Mac, and Chrome Extensions, and web platform--fits into the picture. 

## The Challenge Loom Faces, And Why I'm Energized

Recently, we transitioned Octalysis Prime to a freemium model. Since I'm responsible for Community first, and then Product, it was on me to [listen to members](https://vimeo.com/259389911/c56dfaac57), communicate [our roadmap](https://www.loom.com/share/cddbe68c2ec84bd98185be23f4f030fd), and continually help them reach their goals. Meanwhile, I helped the team efficiently execute on our go-to-market strategy for freemium. In the last two months we had our lowest churn in the past year and the path is set for freemium to play out. 

Here's an important question: Can we improve our conversion of freemium members to premium monthly/annual subscriptions?

This will be an important challenge for Loom to tackle as well. 

Loom is a great product, but companies will ask themselves why they should pay for something that already works, and is currently free. 

"But it's 10x better than email!" Maybe. 

Having reviewed the Product Roadmap, I believe that Loom--with pro and enterprise features--will be 10x better than email, and a necessary addition to any company serious about communicating effectively in the next decade. 

This said, I don't think Loom as instantiated TODAY is there quite yet. And Loom isn't short of competitors who could make copycats or their own versions of video-based communication.

Helping Loom deliver would by a large margin be my biggest challenge yet. But for a product I'm passionate about, in a space I'm passionate about--communication at work--and for a company with A+ people surrounding me, I know I'll rise to it. 

From my read of your posting and from my take on your culture, you're looking for someone who can own the role from Day 1, but who is also coachable, and finally, a curious and weird individual who makes other people better.

As a PM with Loom, I believe my interpersonal skills, ability to create productive relationships with every individual within the organization, and my balanced attack of design/business/tech will put us on pace to scale Loom to our expectations.

## A Few Questions

What innovation patent is Joe speaking about in [this video to Joshua](https://www.loom.com/use-cases/leadership)?

How does Loom approach product? Which workflows have you found effective? I sense that Loom approaches Product cross-functionally. Can you share more?

What is the current relationship between teams at Loom? How are decisions made? How has the team responded to Vinay's departure? 

How has the decision to raise additional venture capital affected Loom's goals?

I want to hear some stories that encapsulate your definition of 'weird'.

Building relationships is really important to me, so I love [how Loom approaches Onboarding new Loommates](https://www.loom.com/blog/how-to-make-remote-onboarding-personal-and-scalable/). What else can you say about the first few weeks and months of working at Loom? 

## Understanding Loom

In this section, I'm simply sharing a few thoughts out loud as I looked more deeply into Loom.

## For Reference

Here is a list of people I've work for, worked with, and managed. Some hired me, some coached me, but I learned something from all of them. 

Instead of over-filtering this list, I wanted to demonstrate transparency. I believe I've built strong relationships with a variety of people, in and outside work, yet I'm open to the possibility that any one of these people may have interesting or even negative things to say about me. As I learned from Charlie Peters, all characters and all people have flaws, and so much the better if you begin to learn what mine are if we are to work together and thrive. 

The list will appear here shortly.

I appreciate you taking the time to review my thoughts and questions about the PM role.

## Let's Make Audacious Goals a Reality

First, off, congrats on [the Series B](https://www.loom.com/blog/why-we-raised-a-30m-series-b-from-sequoia/). It definitely seems like Loom is in a good position to make communication more human, at scale.  

I'd love to join as [the PM for the core platform](https://jobs.lever.co/useloom/b7066f2b-fdde-4baf-a1a6-0c23a78f0c97).

## A Few Questions

What innovation patent is Joe speaking about in [this video to Joshua](https://www.loom.com/use-cases/leadership)?

How does Loom approach product? Which workflows have you found effective? I sense that Loom approaches Product cross-functionally. Can you share more?

What is the current relationship between teams at Loom? How are the toughest decisions made? 

How has the decision to raise additional venture capital affected Loom's goals?

I want to hear some stories that encapsulate your definition of 'weird'.

Building relationships is really important to me, so I love [how Loom approaches Onboarding new Loommates](https://www.loom.com/blog/how-to-make-remote-onboarding-personal-and-scalable/). What else can you say about the first few weeks and months of working at Loom? 


## Thank you
